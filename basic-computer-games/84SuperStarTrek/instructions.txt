      INSTRUCTIONS FOR 'SUPER STAR TREK'

1. WHEN YOU SEE \COMMAND ?\ PRINTED, ENTER ONE OF THE LEGAL
     COMMANDS (NAV,SRS,LRS,PHA,TOR,SHE,DAM,COM, OR XXX).
2. IF YOU SHOULD TYPE IN AN ILLEGAL COMMAND, YOU'LL GET A SHORT
     LIST OF THE LEGAL COMMANDS PRINTED OUT.
3. SOME COMMANDS REQUIRE YOU TO ENTER DATA (FOR EXAMPLE, THE
     'NAV' COMMAND COMES BACK WITH 'COURSE (1-9) ?'.)  IF YOU
     TYPE IN ILLEGAL DATA (LIKE NEGATIVE NUMBERS), THAN COMMAND
     WILL BE ABORTED

     THE GALAXY IS DIVIDED INTO AN 8 X 8 QUADRANT GRID,
AND EACH QUADRANT IS FURTHER DIVIDED INTO AN 8 X 8 SECTOR GRID.

     YOU WILL BE ASSIGNED A STARTING POINT SOMEWHERE IN THE
GALAXY TO BEGIN A TOUR OF DUTY AS COMANDER OF THE STARSHIP
\ENTERPRISE\; YOUR MISSION: TO SEEK AND DESTROY THE FLEET OF
KLINGON WARWHIPS WHICH ARE MENACING THE UNITED FEDERATION OF
PLANETS.

     YOU HAVE THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS AVAILABLE TO YOU AS CAPTAIN
OF THE STARSHIP ENTERPRISE:

\NAV\ COMMAND = WARP ENGINE CONTROL --
     COURSE IS IN A CIRCULAR NUMERICAL      4  3  2
     VECTOR ARRANGEMENT AS SHOWN             . . .
     INTEGER AND REAL VALUES MAY BE           ...
     USED.  (THUS COURSE 1.5 IS HALF-     5 ---*--- 1
     WAY BETWEEN 1 AND 2                      ...
                                             . . .

                                            COURSE
     ONE WARP FACTOR IS THE SIZE OF 
     ONE QUADTANT.  THEREFORE, TO GET
     FROM QUADRANT 6,5 TO 5,5, YOU WOULD
     USE COURSE 3, WARP FACTOR 1.

\SRS\ COMMAND = SHORT RANGE SENSOR SCAN
     SHOWS YOU A SCAN OF YOUR PRESENT QUADRANT.

     SYMBOLOGY ON YOUR SENSOR SCREEN IS AS FOLLOWS:
        <*> = YOUR STARSHIP'S POSITION
        +K+ = KLINGON BATTLE CRUISER
        >!< = FEDERATION STARBASE (REFUEL/REPAIR/RE-ARM HERE!)
         *  = STAR

     A CONDENSED 'STATUS REPORT' WILL ALSO BE PRESENTED.

\LRS\ COMMAND = LONG RANGE SENSOR SCAN
     SHOWS CONDITIONS IN SPACE FOR ONE QUADRANT ON EACH SIDE
     OF THE ENTERPRISE (WHICH IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCAN)
     THE SCAN IS CODED IN THE FORM \###\, WHERE TH UNITS DIGIT
     IS THE NUMBER OF STARS, THE TENS DIGIT IS THE NUMBER OF
     STARBASES, AND THE HUNDRESDS DIGIT IS THE NUMBER OF
     KLINGONS.

     EXAMPLE - 207 = 2 KLINGONS, NO STARBASES, & 7 STARS.

\PHA\ COMMAND = PHASER CONTROL.
     ALLOWS YOU TO DESTROY THE KLINGON BATTLE CRUISERS BY 
     ZAPPING THEM WITH SUITABLY LARGE UNITS OF ENERGY TO
     DEPLETE THEIR SHIELD POWER.  (REMEMBER, KLINGONS HAVE
     PHASERS TOO!)

\TOR\ COMMAND = PHOTON TORPEDO CONTROL
     TORPEDO COURSE IS THE SAME AS USED IN WARP ENGINE CONTROL

     HIS PHASER FIRE.  IN EITHER CASE, YOU ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO 
     THE PHASER FIRE OF ALL OTHER KLINGONS IN THE QUADRANT.

     COMPUTE TORPEDO TRAJECTORY FOR YOU (OPTION 2)

\SHE\ COMMAND = SHIELD CONTROL

     OPTION 2 = PHOTON TORPEDO DATA
        WHICH GIVES DIRECTIONS AND DISTANCE FROM THE ENTERPRISE
        TO ALL KLINGONS IN YOUR QUADRANT
     OPTION 3 = STARBASE NAV DATA
